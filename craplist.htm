		The black list
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  Every once in a while I buy a product that turns out to be poor quality.
	  When this happens, I feel like venting out and telling everyone how useless
	  that roduct is. Now the day has come that something broke down and
	  I am angry enough to initiate this project of shaming bad companies and products. 
	  In the future, I'll try to tell here what I have
	  broken so that these malicioius and incompetent companies would go out of business.
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  Furthermore, I take now the opportunity to bash the useless reviews of products like
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGjWA_Hnvh4">this</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttAW1Tqvw8k">this</a> and
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aFwHSt2_pc"></a>,
	  where the reviewer fiddles around with the products in the comfort of their
	  armchair without really exposing the shortcomings of the thing they claim to review.

		A story of a McKinley drinking bladder
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  I was in Intersport a few days ago, with a friend. She considered buying a McKinley backpack.
	  I told her to get a good backpack instead, trying to share my wisdom that in the woods you really
	  need a good backpack and good shoes, those are not the items to save money on. Well, she took my
	  advise and left the backpack on the shelf. I, on the other hand, bought a drinking bladder and
	  gave myself a lesson reminding not to use McKinley products even on something less critical like
	  a drinking bladder.
	</p>


	<p class="plaintext">
	  Long story short, the closing mechanism of the bladder is a disaster. On the second use,
	  it broke. I have used Source bladders before, and apparently the guys at McKinley
	  tried to copy the closing mechanism from the Source bladders. Source bladders have a
	  plastic rod that is attached to the bladder, the mouth of the bladder rolls around the rod and
	  an external piece of plastic locks the whole thing in place. For images of the mechanism,
	  see <a href="http://sourceoutdoor.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&amp;id_attachment=13">here</a>.
	  The McKinley guys copied the idea, but the plastic rod is not fixed in place, resulting in the
	  slippery PVC sliding through the locking mechanism when the bladder is hanging in the backpack
	  on the bladder holder.
	</p>

	<p class="plaintext">
	  Here's an image of what the McKinley folks would have seen if they had properly tested their product before putting it out on the market.
