		The black list
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  Every once in a while I buy a product that turns out to be poor quality.
	  When this happens, I feel like venting out and telling everyone how useless
	  that roduct is. Now the day has come that something broke down and
	  I am angry enough to initiate this project of shaming bad companies and products. 
	  In the future, I'll try to tell here what I have
	  broken so that these malicioius and incompetent companies would go out of business.
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  Furthermore, I take now the opportunity to bash the useless reviews of products like
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGjWA_Hnvh4">this</a>,
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttAW1Tqvw8k">this</a> and
	  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aFwHSt2_pc"></a>,
	  where the reviewer fiddles around with the products in the comfort of their
	  armchair without really exposing the shortcomings of the thing they claim to review.

		A story of a McKinley drinking bladder
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  I was in Intersport a few days ago, with a friend. She considered buying a McKinley backpack.
	  I told her to get a good backpack instead, trying to share my wisdom that in the woods you really
	  need a good backpack and good shoes, those are not the items to save money on. Well, she took my
	  advise and left the backpack on the shelf. I, on the other hand, bought a drinking bladder and
	  gave myself a lesson reminding not to use McKinley products even on something less critical like
	  a drinking bladder.
	</p>


	<p class="plaintext">
	  Long story short, the closing mechanism of the bladder is a disaster. On the second use,
	  it broke. I have used Source bladders before, and apparently the guys at McKinley
	  tried to copy the closing mechanism from the Source bladders. Source bladders have a
	  plastic rod that is attached to the bladder, the mouth of the bladder rolls around the rod and
	  an external piece of plastic locks the whole thing in place. For images of the mechanism,
	  see <a href="http://sourceoutdoor.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&amp;id_attachment=13">here</a>.
	  The McKinley guys copied the idea, but the plastic rod is not fixed in place, resulting in the
	  slippery PVC sliding through the locking mechanism when the bladder is hanging in the backpack
	  on the bladder holder.
	</p>

	<p class="plaintext">
	  Here's an image of what the McKinley folks would have seen if they had properly tested their product before putting it out on the market.

                Savotta Trooper
        </p>
        <p class="plaintext">
	  I tend to use quite a bit of military surplus stuff, mainly for the reason that
	  it tends to be quite durable. Militaries test their kit quite extensively
	  and anything used by the military has to go through extensive testing.
	  Unfortunately some companies have noticed this and chosen to use their 
	  fame as a military supplier to sell cheaper crap quality items
	  while giving the buyer the impression that the goods are military grade.
	  Savotta is known as a supplier of the Finnish armed forces and I am sad
	  to notice that they have chosen to take their fame and sell to civilians 
	  products that are from a different planet than the goods sold to the military.
        </p>

	  The <a href="http://finn-savotta.fi/en/tuotteet/savotta-trooper-2/">Savotta Trooper</a> satchel is a sad example of poor quality stuff from a renowned
	  manufacturer and probably an example of how one can get pretty much everything wrong
	  in a simple item like a satchel:<br />

	  1. The stitching of the flap is off and as a result, the velcro attachment of the flap does not attach properly.<br />
	  2. The material of the bag is cordura lined with pvc, with the lining falling off after a few weeks of use.<br />
	  After the lining falls off, it is just a matter of time before the bag has a hole in it.
	  3. The PALS straps are of the cheapest kind and start to wear out within months.<br />
	  4. The transparent film in the map pouch is punctured in no time, even in summertime use.<br />
	  5. There is a transparent compartment for an ID card that works as a sure way of losing your ID.<br />
	  6. In some bags, the nylon straps are sewn to the body of the bag with a patch of nylon on the flipside
	  of the bag for durable stitching, not in Savotta Trooper. As a result, the shoulder strap
	  stitching will start to fail in a matter of weeks.<br />

	  Seriously. What else could the Savotta folks have messed up? Oh yes. The pen holder
	  in the inside could be too small to hold a pen. Shame on you, Savotta.

	  Below are a few pictures of what the Savotta folks would have seen if they chose
	  to use their own product for a few months.
