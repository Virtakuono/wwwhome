				A perfect shirt
			</p>
			<p class="header2">
				Intro
			</p>
			<p class="plaintext">
				In the last few years that I've worn men's dress shirts pretty
				much on a daily basis. I have unfortunately noticed that it is
				not at all simple to find a shirt that both fits and has other
				nice properties that one could expect from a piece of quality clothing.
				The bright side of the thing is, I've found pretty much every
				desirable feature in a shirt, but not all of them at once. Even
				the more expensive shirts from more reputable manufacturers seem
				to have shortcomings that bug me every now and then. Below I'll
				list some thoughts on what kind of a shirt I'd like to have
				and what are the properties that irritate me. In case you can
				recommend a good place to buy a shirt satisfying these criteria,
				please let me know.

				Collar
			</p>
			<p class="plaintext">
				Stiffeners.
				These come in two different categories: stitched in or removable.
				Overall, both of them have their benefits. If the collar has retractable
				stiffeners, it is likely to last longer than a collar with stitched in
				stiffeners. However, the collar is also more likely to look a bit untidy
				like this purple shirt from youtailor.eu. This happens since one
				cannot push the stiffeners deep enough for them to reach the tip of the collar.
				One can improve the situation a bit by ironing, but still, towards the end of the
				day the tips of my purple youtailor.eu shirt tend to fold.
			</p>

			<p class="plaintext">
			  For comparison, the stitched in collar stiffeners tend to wear out the fabric
			  at the tips of the collars, like in the case of this Stenstr&ouml;s shirt.

			  Ideally, one would have a shirt that has the durability and ease of stitched in
			  stiffeners but the durability of the removable stiffeners. Honestly, I don't know
			  if such shirts exist, but the search is on.
			</p>

			<p class="plaintext">
				Interfacing.
				This is probably the biggest single problem I've had in a dress shirt.
				To make the fabric a bit stiffer, some manufacturers glue some interfacing
				fabrics into the collars (and cuffs) of shirts. While this generates a nice
				tidy impression when the shirt is new, it's a recipe for disaster when
				the glue no longer holds. One has ugly, bubbly texture on the fabric, like
				in the case of this tailor-made shirt from Jeddah.

				Unfortunately, one can
				run into this phenomenon also in more expensive shirts, I've had the same problem
				in a very expensive shirt by Stenstr&ouml;ms as well.
			</p>
			<p class="plaintext">
			  On the other hand, one can see collars without interfacing. I've run into these shirts
			  from Jermyn Street in London. The collar seems super durable and there is no risk of the ugly
			  bubbly look. However, the problem with these shirts is that sometimes the topmost layer
			  of fabric is too loose and it is hard to iron without making a crease like on this shirt from
			  T M Lewin.
			</p>
			<p class="plaintext">
				Accents.
				I have a thing for tiny details, or accents. All too often a white shirt with no
				colourful details gives an impression of a funeral attire. I've also heard a friend
				refer to these shirts with the derogatory term "Gypsy shirts". I am not sure if I agree
				with the choice of words, but I do want my shirts to have some nice details such as a
				different color of fabric in the inside or in the underside of the collar. This gives
				a bit more flavor to the shirt especially when the shirt is worn without a tie.
				This is mostly a problem with the Jermyn Street shirts, that often have many nice
				characteristics, most notably durability and quality of fabric. But I just feel that
				they are a bit too businessy, and need a necktie to go with them.

				Fit
			</p>
			<p class="plaintext">
				Above, I've gone to great lengths about shirts without
				making any remarks about probably the most important property of a shirt. Namely, the fit. It goes without saying that even if your shirt has all the bells and whistles in it and it's been stitched from the finest of fabrics with fanciest of yearn, it's not going to do much good for you if it's the wrong size.
				This, unlike the properties commented above is much more subject to taste and depending on who's wearing the shirt. Thus, I'll refrain this time from commenting on that any more than I have. Perhaps some other time.
