		The black list
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  Every once in a while I buy a product that turns out to be poor quality.
	  When this happens, I feel like venting out and telling everyone what a piece
	  of crap a given product is. Now the day has come that something broke down and
	  I am angry enough to initiate this. In the future, I'll try to tell here what I have
	  broken so that these malicioius and incompetent companies would go out of business.

		McKinley Drinking bladder
	</p>
	<p class="plaintext">
	  I was in Intersport a few days ago, with a friend. She considered buying a McKinley backpack.
	  I told her to get a good backpack instead, trying to share my wisdom that in the woods you really
	  need a good backpack and good shoes, those are not the items to save money on. Well, she took my
	  advise and left the backpack on the shelf. I, on the other hand, bought a drinking bladder and
	  gave myself a lesson reminding not to use McKinley products even on something less critical like
	  a drinking bladder.
	</p>


	<p class="plaintext">
	  Long story short, the closing mechanism of the bladder is a disaster. On the second use,
	  it already gave in. I have used Source bladders before, and apparently the guys at McKinley
	  tried to copy the closing mechanism from the Source bladders. Source bladders have a
	  plastic rod that is attached to the bladder, the mouth of the bladder rolls around the rod and
	  an external piece of plastic locks the whole thing in place. For images of the mechanism,
	  see <a href="http://sourceoutdoor.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=13">here</a>.
	  The McKinley guys copied the idea, but the plastic rod is not fixed in place, resulting in the
	  slippery PVC sliding through the locking mechanism, especially when the bladder is hanging in the backpack
	  using the holder.
